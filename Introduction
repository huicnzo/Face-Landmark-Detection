What is design of algorithm ?

We have a problem, we want to find an algorithm, so we are trying
to design an algorithm.

analysis means trying to estimate how efficient an algorithm is.

two parameters -
1.how long does the
algorithm take to execute on a given piece of hardware.

2.how much space does it take?

we will be focusing on time more than space.
We can add memory card and increase the memory.
time is a rather more limiting parameter in terms of the hardware.

How we will be measuring the running time?
